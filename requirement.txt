Activate your virtual environment if it's not already activated:

On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate


Install the packages you need for your project. For example, if you've installed Flask and SQLAlchemy, you can install them like this:
pip install Flask SQLAlchemy


Generate the requirements.txt file:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

This will create a requirements.txt file in your project directory with a list of installed packages and their versions. The contents of the requirements.txt file will look something like this:
Flask==2.0.1
SQLAlchemy==1.4.30

The specific packages and their versions will depend on the packages you've installed for your project. When you share your project with others or deploy it to a server, they can use the requirements.txt file to install the exact same set of dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
